The filament, a thin piece of metal, is coil shaped in order to allow the length of tungsten within its small environment in order to display the right wavelength of light. Tungsten is a natural solid metal which, in its raw form, is brittle, but in its more pure form, is strong. As the tungsten heats up, the light is formed.
