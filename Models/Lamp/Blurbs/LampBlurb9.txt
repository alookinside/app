The filament, a thin piece of metal, 
is coil shaped in order to allow the 
length of tungsten within its small 
environment in order to display the 
right wavelength of light. Tungsten 
is a natural solid metal which, in 
its raw form, is brittle, but in its 
more pure form, is strong. As the tungsten 
heats up, the light is formed.
