The electricity runs through the two wires 
shown. The transfer of electricity can be 
paralleled with the way the human heart works. 
Just as the blood travels to and from the 
heart, the wire takes electricity from the 
base of the light bulb to the other wire that 
returns the used electricity back to the base. 
The electricity comes in through one side of 
the bulb connection (right side) , goes up 
through the wire, and down through the other 
side (left side).
