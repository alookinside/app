The yellow particles represent electrons in particles. Wires are made of metal because metal conducts electricity, meaning metals allow electrons to flow easily between particles, shown as orange and red. This flow of electron is what is called electricity and is energy that can either shock you when you touch an open wire, or more importantly, light a bulb!
