The base of the lightbulb has 4 major responsibilities. It has to support the light bulb within the electrical source unit, protect the insulation that prevents the electricity from going into the lamp, transfer the electricity from the main electrical source unit to the inner area of the bulb, and secure the globe. In addition the base of the light bulb acts as a screw, allowing it to be connected to the lamp or another light fixture.
