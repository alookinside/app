The CPU (central processing unit) of the computer carries the instructions of 
a computer program by performing basic operations of the computer program. It 
contains the Arithmetic Logic Unit, which is responsible for executing 
functions. The CPU also contains the Memory Data Register, which keeps 
track of both the data and the address of the data. Communication is 
facilitated by data buses.
