The plug connects to an outlet, and the electricity flows into the base of the blender and to the motor. The wire is long enough to allow for optimal placement of the blender.The heavy base of the blender provides stability to handle the vigorous movement of the blades and food. This prevents the blender from changing position, which could cause it to fall off a counter or table.
