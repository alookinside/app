The ball of the pen, held by a socket, acts as an 
intermediary between the surface being written on 
and the ink tube. As the pen moves across a surface, 
the ball rolls and the force of gravity pushes the 
ink onto the paper through the ball. While this 
mechanism allows the ink to flow when there’s rolling, 
it also seals the ink tube, preventing stored ink from 
drying. This process is similar to how roll-on deodorant 
works, only on a smaller scale.
