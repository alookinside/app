The cam and follower mechanism consists of 2 to 4 parts, two of which are the cam and the follower. The cam is the structure with red outlines, whereas the follower is in pink. The red bars are part of the inner wall of the pen and do not move. They may also be part of the follower in some pens. When you click the pen, the follower pushes on the cam, which begins to slide. This sliding, if the system is bent into the shape of a circle, resembles a rotation. Because the cam is attached to the ing gauge and tip of the pen, and is pushed outward, the pen’s ink gauge and tip also begin moving out.
